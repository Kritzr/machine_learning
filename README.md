# machine_learning


This repository contains a collection of various machine learning models implemented and tested on different datasets. The goal is to explore and experiment with different algorithms, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and compare their performance.

## Models Implemented

So far, the following machine learning models have been implemented:

1. **Linear Regression**: A simple regression model used for predicting continuous values.
2. **Perceptron**: A single-layer neural network model used for binary classification tasks.
3. **Backpropagation (Multilayer Perceptron)**: An advanced neural network that uses backpropagation for training, suitable for more complex datasets and multi-class classification.
4. **Decision Tree Construction**: A decision tree classifier that splits data based on feature values to classify data.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with this repository, you need Python 3.x and the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have `pip`, you can install it by following the official Python documentation.

### Required Libraries:

- `numpy` - for handling numerical operations.
- `pandas` - for working with datasets.
- `scikit-learn` - for machine learning models and evaluation.
- `matplotlib` - for data visualization.
- `seaborn` - for enhanced visualizations.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-models.git
    cd machine-learning-models
    ```

2. To run a specific model, navigate to the corresponding script or Jupyter notebook:

   - `linear_regression.py` - Example usage of Linear Regression.
   - `perceptron.py` - Example usage of the Perceptron.
   - `backpropagation.py` - Example usage of the Backpropagation Neural Network.
   - `decision_tree.py` - Example usage of Decision Tree Classifier.

   Each of these files contains a basic structure that loads a dataset, fits a model, and evaluates its performance.

3. Optionally, you can run the models from a Jupyter notebook environment by opening the corresponding `.ipynb` files.

## Data

This repository currently uses publicly available datasets, typically from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) or other well-known sources. Feel free to replace the datasets with your own as long as they follow the same structure.

## Model Performance

Each model is evaluated based on various metrics, such as:

- **Accuracy** (for classification problems)
- **Mean Squared Error** (for regression tasks)
- **Confusion Matrix** (for classification tasks)

These performance metrics are printed out after the model is trained and evaluated.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests if you'd like to contribute. All contributions are welcome, whether it's bug fixes, performance improvements, or the addition of new models.

## Future Improvements

- Add more machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machine, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest).
- Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.
- Implement cross-validation for model evaluation.
- Experiment with deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs.
